It is quantic time that we investigate options for financing your projects. It doesn't matter if you are looking to fund a new business idea or just a side project, there are options at all levels. For instance, there are microgrants up to $5000 for small side projects. For bigger business ideas, you have recurring grants, government funds, and crowdsourcing options.

## Crowdfunding Options
The concept has been around for a while and can at times be the spark that makes a project take off.

There are different models, the traditional crowdfunded project asks for funds given some budget and project proposition. If the project reach the donation goal you can receive extra benefits apart from the actual product.

Other models are more focused on the community, where members of the community pitch in a certain amount of money per time unit, e.g. once a month.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, there are more funding options for your project ideas than you can ever imagine. However, you need to work on your ideas and make sure that they are realistic and sustainable. I am sure that the funding providers are getting bombarded with fraud attempt all day every day. Just don't look like one of them and you should be good. Put in the effort to prepare your pitch deck and present your ideas nicely. The obvious first step in pitching your projects is to create a website. I have a detailed article on how to set up a free website with GitHub Pages. If you want to check it out, the link is in the resources section above. After your project is in a basic presentable format, you can start applying for grants to bring your project to life. If your project becomes a success, you can look for further funding to make it into a commercial success.

In general, I would recommend looking for funding after developing your project as much as possible. This massively increases your chances of getting attention. Also, Investors love it when they see a potential success in their hands. Good luck in your project journey and let me know of your failures and success so I can feature them in an article or a video.
