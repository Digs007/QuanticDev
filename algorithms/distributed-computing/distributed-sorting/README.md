# Distributed Sorting - Google Interview Question - Algorithm and System Design - Full 2 Hour Interview Walkthrough
If you were given 1 TB of data and asked to sort it using 1000 computers, how would you do it. This is a Google senior interview question, and below is a summary of the optimum solution. In this article, we will do the full 2-hour interview stages together and get hired!

First off, let's check out the agenda for this writeup. We will start by visualizing the problem. Then we will continue with a concise design document. This is probably going to be on a whiteboard in a real interview, so we will keep it short. In the document, we will define the problem, do requirements analysis, do system design using a simple diagram, and finally do the complexity analysis. Then we will actually code and implement this system. Then we'll add some tests. And we will close it off with a discussion with the interviewers.
