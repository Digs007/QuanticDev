/**
 * Given k sorted arrays, merge them into a single sorted array.
 *
 * In this solution, we will use tournament trees to generate a single sorted array as efficiently as possible.
 *
 * This is a rather large topic and I highly recommend you check out my animated video on this topic to get a better
 * understanding of this problem and it's variants (like distributed sort) and their solutions.
 * You can find the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo54nlPHSpg
 *
 * Time Complexity: Î˜(n logk) - Notice the big Theta notation. k is the number of given input arrays.
 * Auxiliary Space: ~2k (to store the tournament tree) + n to store the output
 *
 * @param inputArrays - An array of arrays to be merged.
 * @returns - The merged array (sorted).
